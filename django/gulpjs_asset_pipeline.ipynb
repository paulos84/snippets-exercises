    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I'll show how to make an asset pipeline for a single\n",
    "Django app that will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* concatenate multiple CSS files, write out the un-minified CSS to the ``built/``\n",
    "  directory, then minify the CSS and output the minified CSS as a ``.min.css``\n",
    "  file with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Note: we'll also re-base any URLs to linked images etc. in the source CSS files,\n",
    "    re-basing them in the output ``built/`` directory where the combined CSS file\n",
    "    will be written, so as not to break any related file links.\n",
    "\n",
    "* concatenate multiple JS files into multiple different *\"bundles\"* for\n",
    "  different platforms (mobile and desktop), output the concatenated files to\n",
    "  the ``built/`` directory, then run *uglifyJS* on the files to minify/obfusticate\n",
    "  them, writing these files out as ``.min.js`` in the ``built/`` directory too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* setup *JSHint* to run over the Javascript code in the app that you've written\n",
    "  (excluding any library code) and outputting nicely formatted *lint* warnings\n",
    "  that should be addressed in your Javascript code before commit/deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* setup a ``clean`` task (similar to a ``makefile``) to remove any built files\n",
    "  from the system (will be run as a dependency of the build tasks above).\n",
    "\n",
    "*...these tasks represent things you'd commonly want to do within the context of\n",
    "a single app.*\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "   Details concerning *SASS* compilation into CSS are not included here. See\n",
    "   the guide on :doc:`compile-sass` for details on that score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Set up your Gulp environment\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not used Gulp before, :doc:`set up your environment by following this guide <setup-gulp>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Install gulp and the plugins\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the terminal, ``cd`` into the root of your Django app\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, refer to the `gulp plugin directory <http://gulpjs.com/plugins/>`_ to\n",
    "  find the plugins you'd like to use for your asset pipeline.  For this\n",
    "  example, we'll use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ``gulp`` - the master package\n",
    "  * ``del`` - deletes files (used for cleaning)\n",
    "  * ``gulp-concat`` - concatenates files together\n",
    "  * ``gulp-css-rebase-urls`` - rebases URLs in CSS files\n",
    "  * ``gulp-rename`` - renames files\n",
    "  * ``gulp-minify-css`` - minifies CSS\n",
    "  * ``gulp-uglify`` - runs uglifyJS to minify/obfusticate Javascript\n",
    "  * ``merge-stream`` - allows multiple streams to converge\n",
    "  * ``gulp-jshint`` - lint for Javascript\n",
    "  * ``jshint-stylish`` - styled output from JSHint\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install the plugins with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code-block:: none\n",
    "\n",
    "   sudo npm install gulp del gulp-concat gulp-css-rebase-urls gulp-rename gulp-minify-css gulp-uglify merge-stream gulp-jshint jshint-stylish --save\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In the set up guide, you may remember that we installed gulp. We're installing ``gulp`` \n",
    "     *again* in order to add it's requirement into the ``package.json`` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The ``--save`` flag on the end of the command means that after\n",
    "     installation, the installed items are added into the requirements list\n",
    "     stored in ``package.json``.  By default, the versions listed in the\n",
    "     ``package.json`` file will be prefixed by ``^``, meaning\n",
    "     *\"install this version or higher\"*.  If you specify a ``--save-exact``\n",
    "     flag, you can freeze the exact versions instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If you need to install any plugins at a later date into the pipeline,\n",
    "     you can run the same command, but just list the new plugins, e.g.\n",
    "     ``sudo npm install gulp-some-plugin --save``.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **If you're not creating an asset-pipeline**, merely using an existing\n",
    "     one, you just need to run the command ``npm install`` in the same directory\n",
    "     as the ``package.json`` file (this would be the equivalent of doing\n",
    "     ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` on a pre-existing project).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Installed node-modules live in the ``node_modules/`` directory at the same\n",
    "     level as ``package.json`` when you run ``npm install``.  **Add** ``node_modules/*`` **to your** ``.gitignore`` **file!**\n",
    "\n",
    "*...That's it, gulp is now installed. Now move on to making a gulpfile\n",
    "file that will tell gulp where your files are and what to do with them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Setup a gulpfile\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've followed the :doc:`guide to setting up your Gulp environment <setup-gulp>` , you should have a blank ``gulpfile.js`` in the root of your Django app. If not, go and do it now. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ``gulpfile`` files you'll see around the web will typically follow a common\n",
    "3-section structure, we'll set them up one at a time.  The 3 sections are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plugins section:** load the plugins you've installed in step 2, ready for use.\n",
    "* **Paths section:** a section dedicated to listing/bundling CSS/JS resources relative\n",
    "  to the ``gulpfile`` file.\n",
    "* **Tasks section:** where we'll defined named tasks (runnable from the command-line)\n",
    "  that string together processing pipelines consisting of *gulp* plugins loaded in\n",
    "  the plugins section that will process the files listed in the path section as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3.1: Plugins section\n",
    "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is trivially easy.  Make a ``var`` statement at the top of the\n",
    "file, and use ``require()`` to pul in all the plugins installed in Step 2,\n",
    "storing them in local Javascript variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's start with the ``clean`` tasks...they're the easiest to explain:\n",

    ".. code-block:: javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "   gulp.task('clean_css', function(cb) {\n",

    "  individually, and a combined ``clean`` task to do both the JS and CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``clean_css`` and ``clean_js`` tasks uses the ``del`` plugin we installed\n",
    "  earlier.  This is simply a plugin that gets passed an array of file-paths\n",
    "  relative to the ``gulpfile`` that may include wildcards. Any files matching\n",
    "  the passed paths will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This also serves as your first introduction to the ``gulp.task()`` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The first parameter to ``gulp.task()`` is the name of the task.  This should be\n",
    "    unique within a single ``gulpfile`` and is the name by which you can run\n",
    "    the task from the command-line.  For e.g., after doing the above, we could\n",
    "    run ``gulp clean_js`` from the command-line and all the Javascript files\n",
    "    in the ``built/`` directory would be deleted from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The 2nd parameter is optional.  You can see it's omitted in the ``clean_css``\n",
    "    and ``clean_js`` tasks.  It is present in the ``clean`` task however.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This list (if specified) is a list of named tasks defined within the same\n",
    "    ``gulpfile`` that are *\"dependencies\"* of the task being defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Being a dependency merely means that any tasks appearing in this list will\n",
    "    be run and completed **before** the task itself is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the case of the ``clean`` task, you can see that we've combined the\n",
    "    ``clean_css`` and ``clean_js`` tasks under the single name ``clean``, then\n",
    "    do nothing else.  Running ``gulp clean`` at the command-line will run the\n",
    "    ``clean_css`` and ``clean_js`` tasks as dependencies, then exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The last parameter passed to ``gulp.task()`` should be a function that\n",

    "\n",
    "    The ``cb`` parameter passed is optional, it can be ignored most of the\n",

    "* The first line serves as your first introduction to streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * As mentioned above, *gulp* is a stream-based task-runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike *grunt*, which also defines processing pipelines, *gulp* streams\n",
    "    files byte-by-byte from the first link in the chain to the next and so-on,\n",
    "    all processing stages happen in parallel, concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is what makes *gulp* massively faster than *grunt*. *grunt* chooses to\n",
    "    process each individual pipeline stage to completion, before handing over the\n",
    "    intermediate result to the next stage.  Nothing happens in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The first line, ``gulp.src()`` is fed the list of file-paths defined in\n",
    "    Step 3.2, in the case of the ``css`` task, the CSS file-paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It opens each file in-turn and begins streaming it's bytes into the\n",
    "    next stage in the processing pipeline until it's finished passing all files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For e.g. in the case of the 2 CSS files, ``styles.css`` and ``clippy.css``,\n",
    "    the stream will look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "    Usage of the ``pipe()`` method is the thing connects the streaming output\n",

    "  is vital information to any re-basing process).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The next processing stage, ``concat()`` is the stage that concatenates the\n",
    "  CSS.  It will receive all the stream from ``rebase()``, but modifies it to produce\n",
