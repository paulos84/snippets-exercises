In the DevOps world there’s been an explosion of tools in release (jenkins, travis, teamcity),
configuration management (puppet, chef, ansible, cfengine), orchestration (zookeeper, noah, mesos),
monitoring, virtualization and containerization (AWS, OpenStack, vagrant, docker) and many more.

Three general topics:

Infrastructure Automation – create your systems, OS configs, and app deployments as code.

Continuous Delivery – build, test, deploy your apps in a fast and automated manner.

Site Reliability Engineering – operate your systems; monitoring and orchestration, sure, but also designing for
operability in the first place.
