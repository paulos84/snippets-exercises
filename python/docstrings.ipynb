Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils. Sphinx cheatsheet: https://matplotlib.org/sampledoc/cheatsheet.html\n",

This directory also contains the Sphinx configuration file conf.py, where you can configure all aspects of how Sphinx reads your sources and builds your documentation.

    "\n",
    "sphinx-quickstart creates a source directory with conf.py and a master document, index.rst. The main function of the master document is to serve as a welcome page, and to contain the root of the “table of contents tree” (or toctree).

Arguments are given directly after the double colon following the directive’s name. Each directive decides whether it can have arguments, and how many. Options are given after the arguments, in form of a “field list”. The maxdepth is such an option for the toctree directive. Content follows the options or arguments after a blank line. Each directive decides whether to allow content, and what to do with it. A common gotcha with directives is that the first line of the content must be indented to the same level as the options are.\n",

You can now create the files you listed in the toctree and add content, and their section titles will be inserted (up to the maxdepth level) at the place where the toctree directive is placed.\n",

There are several more directives for documenting other types of Python objects, for example py:class or py:method. n.b. Python is the default domain, so can omit the py: as in the example for enumerate above. There is also a cross-referencing role for each of these object types.
