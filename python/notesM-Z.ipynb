The accepted approach in Python is to xxpose your instance variables directly, e.g. foo.x = 0, not foo.set_x(0), which preserves the access semantics. The main advantage to this approach is that the caller gets to do this: foo.x += 1 instead of the less-readable: foo.set_x(foo.get_x() + 1)\n",

    "One of the most fundamental paradigms of nearly all programming languages is the ability to store values in variables, and later retrieve or modify those values. In fact, the ability to store values and pull values out of variables is what gives a program state. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the inclusion of variables into our program begets the most interesting questions we will now address: where do those variables live? In other words, where are they stored? And, most importantly, how does our program find them when it needs them? These questions speak to the need for a well-defined set of rules for storing variables in some location, and for finding those variables at a later time. We'll call that set of rules: Scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has *lexical scoping* whereby a variable may only be called or referenced from within the block of code in which it is defined. Whilst functions might be the basic unit of scope declaration, there are other blocks of code that define scopes, e.g. control flow and loop blocks. The same identifier name can be specified at multiple layers of nested scope, which is called “shadowing”. Regardless of shadowing, scope look-up always starts at the innermost scope being executed at the time, and works its way outward/upward until the first match, and stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "A closure function is any function that uses a variable that is defined in an environment (or scope) that is external to that function, and is accessible within the function when invoked from a scope in which that free variable is not defined. Closures in computer programming are generally useful as callback functions. Python provides support for closures via lexical scoping. Use-cases include lazy evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/closures.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, `mult6` and `mult7` are function closures. They are functions because `make_multiplier` returns the function `multiply`. It is a closure because the returned function refers to the free variable factor. The factor variable is local in the scope of `make_multiplier`, but not in the scope of `multiply`. Since this variable is referenced by the returned function, Python knows it needs to store that variable along with the returned function, and not garbage-collect it once `make_multiplier` completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a variable named factor was defined in the calling scope, it has nothing to do with the factor variable in the closure.  In the second example, `main` is a function with a local variable named `factor`. The local `factor` and the closure `factor` have nothing to do with each other. For each instance of the `multiply` closure, factor is the one from the closure, so the results of invoking it are unchanged. In main, the `factor` variable is assigned *10* and not changed, so it is still *10* when printed at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its nature, Python doesn’t have variable declaration semantics. A variable is “declared” when it’s name is bound to an object. Contrast with JavaScript e.g. `function myFunc(){var a; a = 2; alert(a)}`. One caveat is that it is an error to delete a name of a variable that is referenced in an enclosing scope.  If Python needs to be able to access factor when mult6 is invoked, it cannot have it deleted!"
