    "**Objects, values and types**\n",
    "Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s identity never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. The ‘is’ operator compares the identity of two objects; the id() function returns an integer representing its identity. In the following example, the 'is' operator returns False since although the values are the same their identities are different"
