Getters and setters are used in many object oriented programming languages to ensure the principle of data encapsulation (the bundling of data with the methods that operate on these data). The accepted approach in Python is to xxpose your instance variables directly, e.g. foo.x = 0, not foo.set_x(0), which preserves the access semantics. The main advantage to this approach is that the caller gets to do this: foo.x += 1 instead of the less-readable: foo.set_x(foo.get_x() + 1)\n",
