    "A plaintext markup syntax and parser system. The primary goal of reStructuredText is to define and implement a markup syntax for use in Python docstrings and other documentation domains, that is readable (compared to e.g. HTML) and simple, yet powerful enough for non-trivial use. The intended purpose of the markup is the conversion of reStructuredText documents into useful structured data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Structured Text\" is probably a bit of a misnomer. It's more like \"Relaxed Text\" that uses certain consistent patterns. These patterns are interpreted by a HTML converter to produce \"Very Structured Text\" that can be used by a web browser. The most basic pattern recognised is a paragraph which is a chunk of text that is separated by blank lines. Paragraphs must have the same indentation. Paragraphs that start indented will result in indented quote paragraphs. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a paragraph.  It's quite\n",
    "short.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This paragraph will result in an indented block of\n",
    "   text, typically used for quoting other text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using inline markup, e.g. bold and italic text is similar to markdown, e.g. using asterixes and backslash for escaping."
