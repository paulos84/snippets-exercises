    "Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant. Eg. multitasking on a single-core machine. Parallelism is when two or more tasks  run at the same time, e.g. on a multicore processor. Concurrency can be characterized as a property of a program or system and parallelism as the runtime behaviour of executing multiple tasks at the same time. "

    "The threading module is used for working with threads in Python. The CPython implementation has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which allows only one thread to be active in the interpreter at once. The mechanism used by the CPython interpreter to assure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This simplifies the CPython implementation by making the object model (including critical built-in types such as dict) implicitly safe against concurrent access. Locking the entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-threaded, at the expense of much of the parallelism afforded by multi-processor machines. This means that threads cannot be used for parallel execution of Python code. While parallel CPU computation is not possible, parallel IO operations are possible using threads. This is because performing IO operations releases the GIL. What are threads used for in Python? \n",

    "For parallel execution of tasks use multiprocessing, a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module.

    "The most obvious way is to use multiple processes. From the terminal you can start your script two, three, four…ten times and then all the scripts are going to run independently or at the same time. The operating system that's underneath will take care of sharing your CPU resources among all those instances. Using CPython that's actually the only way you can get to use more than one CPU at the same time.\n",

But because of this it's difficult to write a threading code. And again, the operating system is doing all the heavy lifting on sharing the CPU, but the global interpreter lock (GIL) allows only one thread to run Python code at a given time even when you have multiple threads running code. So, In CPython, the GIL prevents multi core concurrency. Basically, you’re running in a single core even though you may have two or four or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Asynchronous Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The third way is an asynchronous programming, where the OS is not participating. As far as OS is concerned you're going to have one process and there's going to be a single thread within that process, but you'll be able to do multiple things at once. So, what's the trick? \n",

The nice thing about them is that you don't have to pre-generate all the entire sequence you can generate elements of that sequence as the person calling the generator asks.

Basically, when we reach the yield from in the example above, we are saying: \"OK, loop, I'm done for now, so I give you back control. Please, run this function for me [the one that follows the yield from], so asyncio sleep for 3 seconds. And when that's done I'm ready to continue\". The loop will take note of that and then manage everything. Because it’s a scheduler and that's what it does.
